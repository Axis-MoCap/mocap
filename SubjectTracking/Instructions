Install the following dependacnies before running

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-opencv
sudo pip3 install mediapipe opencv-python RPi.GPIO pigpio
sudo systemctl enable pigpiod
sudo systemctl start pigpiod

-------Hardware Connection--------

Connect your USB webcam to one of the USB ports on the Raspberry Pi 4
Connect the SG90 servo to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins:

Red wire (power) → 5V pin
Brown/Black wire (ground) → GND pin
Yellow/Orange wire (signal) → GPIO pin 18 (you can choose another GPIO pin if needed)


----This system works by:-----

Capturing video frames from your USB webcam
Processing each frame with MediaPipe's pose detection to identify people
Tracking the position of the person's nose relative to the center of the frame
Calculating how much to rotate the servo to keep the person centered
Applying smooth movement to the servo to avoid jerky motion
Displaying the processed video with tracking information

The script provides visual feedback by showing:

The detected pose landmarks
A vertical line indicating the center
The tracking position of the person
Status text indicating whether a person is detected
