ðŸŽ¥ MoCap System â€“ Raspberry Pi Setup Guide
This guide explains how to install everything you need to run the MoCap (motion capture) system on a Raspberry Pi.

âœ… Step 1: Check Python
Python is already included in Raspberry Pi OS. Just make sure it's version 3.7 or newer.

To check, run:   [ python3 --version]

âœ… Step 2: Install pip (Python package manager)
Run these commands: [ sudo apt update , sudo apt install python3-pip ]

âœ… Step 3: Install the required Python libraries
These are the main libraries your MoCap system needs: [pip install numpy opencv-python mediapipe]

âœ… Step 4: Install PyTorch (Torch)
Torch is used to do the skeleton math (IK).
install it like this: [ pip install torch --extra-index-url https://www.piwheels.org/simple]

âœ… Step 5: tqdm for progress bars
This is  useful for showing loading bars. : [pip install tqdm]

ðŸ“¦ What Each Library Does
numpy â€“ math and number handling

opencv-python â€“ captures video from the camera

mediapipe â€“ tracks the body and finds joint positions

torch â€“ handles the skeleton logic (inverse kinematics)

tqdm â€“ shows progress bars (optional)
